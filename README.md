# Data-606-Capstone-Project: Malware Detection using Machine Learning

A detailed description of my project can be viewed <a href="https://sites.google.com/umbc.edu/data606/spring-21-section-2/nikhil-goparapu?authuser=0">here</a>. <br>

<h2>Brief Description:</h2>
    The Malware industry is growing very rapidly day by day. Many organizations around the world are investing heavily in technologies and methods to build a system to detect and deactivate these malware files. Engineers and anti malware communities should build more robust softwares to detect and deactivate these attacks.<br>
<br>   
The goal of this project to extract useful features from raw bytes file and asm file and build a supervised machine learning model on top of those features to classify a malware file.<br>
